# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToeGame.git
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   cd TicTacToeGame
   javac TicTac_CoreCode.java
   java TicTac_CoreCode
   ```

3. **Game Rules:**
   - The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
   - Players take turns marking empty spaces with 'X' or 'O'.
   - The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins.
   - The game ends in a tie if the board is full and no player has won.

## Features

- Two-player game allowing players to take turns.
- Simple console-based UI for ease of use.
- Win and tie detection based on classic Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following components:

- **TicTac_CoreCode.java:** The main class containing the game logic, player turns, move validation, and win/tie detection.

## Game Flow

1. The game starts by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns entering their moves.
3. The game checks for a win or tie after each move.
4. If a win or tie is detected, the game ends and the result is displayed.

## Customize the Game

Feel free to customize the game by modifying parameters, changing symbols, or adding additional features. You can also enhance the game by creating a graphical user interface or adding more advanced AI for the computer player.

```java
// Example: Change symbols
placeMove(board, userInput, 'X'); // Player's symbol
placeMove(board, Integer.toString(computerMove), 'O'); // Computer's symbol

// Example: Customize the grid size (not recommended without code adjustments)
char[][] customBoard = { { ' ', ' ', ' ' }, { ' ', ' ', ' ' }, { ' ', ' ', ' ' } };
```

This Tic-Tac-Toe game has no external dependencies. It is a simple console-based application.
